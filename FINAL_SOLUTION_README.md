# South Park Stream Bot - Final Solution

This is the final solution for the South Park Stream Bot, addressing the "Sandboxing is not allowed" error and other browser-related issues. This version includes comprehensive fixes for Chrome detection, sandboxing restrictions, SSL errors, and connection stability.

## üîß What's Fixed

### 1. Chrome Detection and Sandboxing Issues

- **Enhanced Chrome Detection**: The bot now checks multiple common installation locations for Chrome and uses fallback methods to find it.
- **Sandboxing Fixes**: Implements multiple critical Chrome options to bypass sandboxing restrictions:
  - `--no-sandbox`
  - `--disable-setuid-sandbox`
  - `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
  - Dedicated user data directory

### 2. SSL and Security Errors

- **SSL Error Handling**: Adds options to bypass SSL certificate errors that were causing connection issues:
  - `--ignore-certificate-errors`
  - `--ignore-ssl-errors`
  - `--allow-running-insecure-content`

### 3. Stream Loading Improvements

- **Direct Stream Loading**: Loads the stream URL directly instead of using an iframe with sandbox restrictions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Includes both HTML wrapper and direct URL loading approaches
- **Extended Loading Time**: Gives more time for the stream to initialize properly

### 4. Connection Stability

- **Improved Voice Connection**: Enhanced retry logic for Discord voice connections
- **Reconnection Command**: Added `!reconnect` command to force reconnection when needed
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Chrome browser
- Discord Bot Token (from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Setup

1. Make sure you have a `config.py` file with the following variables:

```python
BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'  # Your Discord bot token
STREAM_URL = 'https://southpark24hours.com/watch'  # South Park stream URL
COMMAND_PREFIX = '!'  # Command prefix for bot commands
STREAM_FPS = 30  # Frames per second for the stream
BROWSER_WIDTH = 1280  # Browser window width
BROWSER_HEIGHT = 720  # Browser window height
HEADLESS_MODE = True  # Run browser in headless mode (no visible window)
```

2. Run the bot using the provided batch file:

```
run_final_solution.bat
```

Or run it directly with Python:

```
python final_solution.py
```

## üéÆ Commands

- `!join` - Join your current voice channel and start streaming South Park
- `!leave` - Leave the voice channel and stop streaming
- `!status` - Check the current status of the bot
- `!reconnect` - Force reconnect to the voice channel (useful if stream freezes)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Chrome is not detected:

1. Make sure Chrome is installed on your system
2. Try reinstalling Chrome from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
3. Add Chrome to your system PATH

### If you still get sandboxing errors:

1. Run the bot with administrator privileges
2. Try disabling your antivirus temporarily
3. Make sure your Chrome installation is not corrupted

### If the stream doesn't load:

1. Check if the stream URL is accessible in your browser
2. Try changing the `STREAM_URL` in `config.py` to an alternative South Park stream
3. Use the `!reconnect` command to force a reconnection

### If voice connection fails:

1. Make sure your bot has the necessary permissions
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try restarting Discord
4. Use the `!reconnect` command

## üìù Technical Details

The final solution uses:

- `discord.py` for Discord integration
- Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- ChromeDriverManager for automatic driver installation
- Custom HTML wrapper for stream loading
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## üîí Security Notes

This solution uses several security bypasses (`--no-sandbox`, etc.) to make the stream work. These are necessary for the functionality but should only be used in a controlled environment. Never use these options for general web browsing.
